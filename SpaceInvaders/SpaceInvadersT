//Main Method
/**
* This main method handles all input from the user and manages the game
* It initially prints the title along with starting game, where the avatar is in the default position.
* In a board of 7 x 9, The first four rows are designated to 20 aliens centred in a cluster of 5 x 4.
* The barriers are located along the 7th row and are static in their position
* The avatar is located on the 9th row, and is free to move within that row.
* The avatar can only move one space for every turn, with input from the user.
* Commands are as follows:
* "a" to move left
* "d" to move right
* "f" to shoot
* "x" to quit the game
* Invalid input will prompt user to enter correct output to continue the game.
* Movement commands call their respective class
