Animation game similar to "space invaders"

How it works:

The alien,shield and avatar objects are stored in a 5x5 2D array [row][col] list. For our first demo we are making a text based version of our game where we prompt the user for input that will be processed and displays the result. Which will be asking user to move the avatar left or right which will update the array list and a new board will be created with the updated input from user. The board class initializes the 2D list with enemies and shield. The avatar class initializes location and movement of the avatar. The main class (Space Invaders) takes the input from user and displays the result.
