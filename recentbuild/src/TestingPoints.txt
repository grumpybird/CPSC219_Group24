In order to test the Points in SpaceInvaders, you have to download the file named SpaceInvaderJunitTest.java. 
Once downloaded import the file into Eclipse along with the rest of the files in this github. 
Once imported, make sure JUnit 4 library is imported and run the SpaceInvaders.java with the test. 
This will then run the test automatically and let user know whether the tests have passed or failed. 
For this demo3, only the testing of a negative score is implemented but for the final submission more tests will be implemented and more thorughly run.
